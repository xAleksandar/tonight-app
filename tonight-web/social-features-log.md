# Tonight App Social Features Log

This log tracks the 20-minute automation passes for the new social features (event detail screen, join requests + approvals, event group chat, friends/DMs).
Each run should:
1. Read the most recent entry to know the current focus.
2. Implement or investigate one small step.
3. Document progress + next steps before exiting.

## 2026-02-12 20:58 EET — Initial setup
- Created branch `feature/tonight-social` from latest `main`.
- Added this log to coordinate 20-minute runs.
- Next focus: design the "event inside" experience (UI + API checklist) before building join requests and chat flows.
